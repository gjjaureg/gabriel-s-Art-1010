					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>

					<h2>Outlines</h2>
					<pre><code> 
Baking sourdough bread

Feed sourdough starter 4-8 hours before baking
Mix dough
  Mix water and sourdough starter until dissolved
  Add bread flour
  Mix ingredients together until fully absorbed
Let dough rest in a covered bowl for 30 minutes
After 30 minutes add salt and knead the dough
Recover the bread in it’s bowl and let the dough rise
Stretch and fold the dough in 30-90 minute increments to create air pockets
  Note: amount of time needed for dough to rise may vary
Shape dough after it has risen
Once dough is shaped, put it in a floured banneton or bowl covered with a floured kitchen towel, cover, and let proof in fridge for 8-12 hours
Once proofed, place in a dutch oven preheated to 450-500 degrees
Bake in a 450-500 degree oven for 20 minutes, before lowering the temperature to 400 and baking for 20-40 minutes until golden brown on the outside
Let rest until completely cooled, 1-2 hours

Set rock, paper, and scissors as variables
Set rock to beat scissors
Set paper to beat rock
Set scissors to beat paper
